The run.exe file can be run from the terminal. It will take all the Roman Numerals written in Input.txt and convert them to Decimaal Numbers and back into Roman Numerals in the Output.txt

This does not have a stringent error system so it will only work with the Roman Numeral symbols. Each input should be placed on its own line as well. 

If the input Roman numeral and the output Roman numeral have the same decimal number, but do not match that most likely means that the input Roman Numeral was not written in the correct order, but was still able to be converted. 

It took me about 40 minutes to write the code to convert Roman Numerals to Decimal and about 2 hours and 20 minutes to go the other way. I spent about 40 minutes straightening things up and adding the input and output files as well. 

The Photos contain some of my early thoughts for converting from Roman Numeral into Decimal. Mostly it was just fiuguring out that by looking at two at a time that it became really easy. 
I don't have handwritten notes for the second part. All of the stuff I did was test by hand integer division, modulus, and substraction before starting to put it together in code with subtaction. I used the same principle of using two roman numeral symbols at once to do some of the calculations. I feel like there is a good way to do this part using modulus %, but I had a few good things going with the method I was using so I stuck with it. 
Making sure 9 became IX instead of VIV ended up being one of the hardest parts.
